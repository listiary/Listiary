GenericTool: 
A tool class that gets part its id and name from properties being set.
Tools get instantiated once. 
Generic tools are used to create multiple different tools (tool classes) - just like generic classes in C#.

DomTool:
Dom tools don't change the JSON tree - instead, they act only on the DOM of the loaded list.
Dom tools are used to prototype tools, most of the time will be replaced later on.
