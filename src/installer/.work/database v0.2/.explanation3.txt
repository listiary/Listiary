1. Main data
There are 2 tables - `describe_documents` and `compiled_documents`, that hold the main data in a listiary wiki. 
`describe_documents` holds the Describe source files, and `compiled_documents` - the compiled versions of those files in JSON.
There are also indexes for each of those tables - `idx_filename`, so that we can quickly search by filename.

```
describe_documents
  .id
  .filename
  .content
  .submitted_at
  
compiled_documents
  .id
  .filename
  .content
  .submitted_at
```





2. Housekeeping
`housekeeping_itemid_filename` table links Describe item ids to filenames they are defined in.
`housekeeping_filename_related` table links files to files needed when loading them.

```
housekeeping_itemid_filename
	.filename
    .item_id

housekeeping_filename_related
    .filename
    .related_filename
```





3. Accounts
The `accounts` table stores the information for the user accounts, as the name suggests.

```
accounts
  .id
  .username
  .usercode
  .password_hash
  .is_bot
  .created_at
```
