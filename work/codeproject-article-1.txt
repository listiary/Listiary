//What This Article Covers

Listiary is a lists-first wiki platform built around the idea that structured, nested lists can be a clearer and more flexible way to organize knowledge than free-form pages. This article introduces the project, its core concepts, and the Describe Markup Language (DML) used to express lists in a readable and machine-parsable form. The current prototype demonstrates interactive list editing, rendering, and basic tooling, and the project continues to evolve with ongoing work on plugins, distributed hosting, and bot-assisted content flows. The goal is to share the model, invite exploration, and welcome developers interested in shaping the platform as it grows.



Introduction

Listiary is a custom wiki platform built for writing lists. Unlike traditional wikis, which focus on free-form text, Listiary is designed from the ground up for structured, interactive, and dynamic lists.

Distributed and sustainable – Users choose servers and content to load, giving Listiary a decentralized model – similar to Mastodon. This flexibility makes a huge difference in terms of moderation and long-term sustainability, compared to rigid centralized platforms.

Bot-fed content – Oracles watch data streams, automated agents post to PHP staging pools, and curator bots log information, so users can enjoy journal style lists while the wiki writes itself in real time.

Security through simplicity - Listiary is a custom platform implemented in plain JavaScript and PHP, without dependencies that could introduce vulnerabilities or maintenance overhead.

A language for lists – Listiary has its own language, called Describe Markup Language (or simply Describe). The Describe Markup Language (DML) compiler utilizes ANTLR 4 in C#, and is a powerful, flexible, tested and documented tool in its own right. Describe is intuitive – anyone can write in it without formal training, allowing rich, interactive lists to be created by anyone.

Extensible via plugins – Developers can write and submit their own add-ons, and users can enable different add-ons to customize their experience. Think music players, fonts and styles, etc.

Flexible monetization – Listiary is free for all, but paid users will be able to host private wikis on our domain, similar to the GitHub Enterprise Cloud and many other platforms, which improves long-term sustainability without compromising the mission of the wiki.

Interactive editing – Users can customize, edit, highlight, and sort public or personal lists, with versioned drafts saved for later, fork their own versions, and even share them on social media if they like.

Tailored to lists – Lists stick out like a sore thumb on many wiki platforms, because large, wide, awkward lists don't fit neatly inside text, or software templates made for presenting text. Listiary lets complex lists shine in elegant and convenient ways – You can have checkbox lists, timed lists that change color or text when they expire, and much, much more endlessly-sortable goodness.



Prototype

The prototype is in an early stage - it is usable but not production-ready. Its layout is screen-flexible and scales to larger displays; the screenshots below show the phone view.

Contributing & Getting Involved

Listiary is an open-source project, and we’re looking for people who are interested in shaping it as it develops. The stack is intentionally simple - mostly vanilla JavaScript, PHP, and some SQL on the platform side. The Describe Markup Language compiler is implemented in C#, and that part is currently maintained.

If you’re comfortable working independently and enjoy taking ownership of what you build, you’ll likely be a good fit. At this stage, the project benefits most from contributors who are self-directed rather than beginners who require guided mentorship.

In addition to development, we welcome help with writing, documentation, community communication, and visual design. Clear communication, approachable documentation, and a consistent visual identity are all things we want to improve as the project grows.

The work is flexible and paced to avoid burnout - contribute when you have time, step back when you need to. Over time, the goal is to move toward more sustainable support, including compensation for core contributors.

If you’re interested in participating, browsing the source, or learning more, start with the GitHub repositories and documentation, and feel free to reach out.
