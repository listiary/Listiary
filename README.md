Listiary is a wiki built from nested lists on various topics. From movie recommendations and playlists to knowledge maps and personal journals.
It’s a flexible, open-source tool for building structured wikis of lists on any topic.

## About  
Listiary is a custom wiki platform built for writing lists. Unlike traditional wikis, which focus on free-form text, Listiary is designed from the ground up for structured, interactive, and dynamic lists.

***Distributed and sustainable*** – Users choose servers and content to load, giving Listiary a decentralized model – similar to Mastodon. This flexibility makes a huge difference in terms of moderation and long-term sustainability, compared to rigid centralized platforms.

***Bot-fed content*** – Oracles watch data streams, automated agents post to PHP staging pools, and curator bots log information, so users can enjoy journal style lists while the wiki writes itself in real time.

***Security through simplicity*** - Listiary is a custom platform implemented in plain JavaScript and PHP, without dependencies that could introduce vulnerabilities or maintenance overhead.

***A language for lists*** – Listiary has its own language, called Describe Markup Language (or simply Describe). The Describe Markup Language (DML) compiler utilizes ANTLR 4 in C#, and is a powerful, flexible, tested and documented tool in its own right. Describe is intuitive – anyone can write in it without formal trainig, allowing rich, interactive lists to be created by anyone.

***Extensible via plugins*** – Developers can write and submit their own add-ons, and users can enable different add-ons to customize their experience. Think music players, fonts and styles, etc.

***Flexible monetization*** – Listiary is free for all, but paid users will be able to host private wikis on our domain, similar to the GitHub Enterprise Cloud and many other platforms, which improves long-term sustainability without compromising the mission of the wiki.

***Interactive editing*** – Users can customize, edit, highlight, and sort public or personal lists, with versioned drafts saved for later, fork their own versions, and even share them on social media if they like.

***Tailored to lists*** – Lists stick out like a sore thumb on many wiki platforms, because large, wide, awkward lists don't fit neatly inside text, or software templates made for presenting text. Listiary lets complex lists shine in elegant and convenient ways – You can have checkbox lists, timed lists that change color or text when they expire, and much, much more endlessly-sortable goodness.
